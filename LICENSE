                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where the free software movement most strongly
 insists that users should have control.  Therefore, we have designed
 this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
 “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

 1. Source Code.

 The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
 form of a work.

 A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights to run the Program without modification, and also to make and
 run a modified version.  Redistribution, modification, and sublicensing
 are permitted, provided you meet the conditions explained below.  You
 may make a copy of the Program and adapt it for your own needs.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 protection measure under applicable law.  When you convey a covered
 work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological
 protection measures.  You also waive any right to invoke such measures
 against the covered work itself.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License (or, in the case of a new version of
    the Program, under a later version of the GPL).

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License does not permit incorporating parts of the Program into
    proprietary programs.  However, you may give permission to
    license the work under certain other licenses, provided that the
    other licenses are compatible with this License.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not display them.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also meet one of these
 conditions:

    a) Convey the object code with the Corresponding Source on a
    physical medium customarily used for software interchange;

    b) Accompany the object code with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give anyone the Corresponding Source in
    exchange for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution; or

    c) Convey the object code by offering access from a network server
    where the Corresponding Source is already available for anyone to
    copy, provided you inform recipients of the location to copy
    that source.  You must take reasonable steps to ensure that this
    Corresponding Source remains available for as long as the object
    code is available.

 7. Additional Terms.

 Additional terms are allowed in the sense that these conditions can
 be applied in conjunction with any other additional permissions or
 conditions, provided they do not contradict this License.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise is void, and will
 terminate your rights under this License.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License merely because you have
 a copy of the Program.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
 modify or propagate the Program.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.

 11. Patents.

 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise
 run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributions.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have the
 additional permission to link or combine any covered work with a work
 licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 provided that the terms of this License are followed for the
 resulting work.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
 detail to address new problems or concerns.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the License
 “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following
 the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
 version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
 does not specify a version number, you may choose any version ever
 published by the Free Software Foundation.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
 COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
 ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
 OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Acceptance of this License.

 BY ACCEPTING THIS LICENSE, YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 PROVIDED ABOVE.
